# Progress

State of the world. Read this first, every session. Append before ending, every
session. Newest entry at the top.

## Current state

**Active phase:** Phase 0
**Blocked on:** nothing
**Next action:** implement `core/constants.py` and `physics/bernoulli.py`

## Physics decisions log

Decisions that affect results, with reasoning. Never silently reverse one of
these; add a new entry instead.

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| init | n_i = 1.0e10 cm^-3 at 300K | matches textbook worked examples used as analytic targets. See docs/06-constants.md |
| init | C_0 = n_i for de Mari scaling | cleanest Poisson form. Revisit if Phase 5 conditioning degrades |
| init | Boltzmann statistics through Phase 4 | Fermi-Dirac deferred to Phase 5 where degenerate S/D makes it necessary |
| init | Structured tensor mesh in Phase 4 | avoids obtuse triangle problem entirely for rectangular geometry |
| init | Steady state only | transient out of scope. C-V by small-signal AC, not time stepping |

## Known deviations from reference

Things that do not match DEVSIM or an analytic result, with the reason, so they
are not rediscovered as bugs later.

| Item | Deviation | Reason | Acceptable? |

## Session log

Format per entry:

    ### YYYY-MM-DD
    **Landed:** what works now
    **Broke:** what failed, what the cause turned out to be
    **Open:** unresolved
    **Next:** the single next action

Write the "Broke" field carefully even when it is embarrassing. The debugging
narrative is the most interesting engineering content this project will produce,
and reconstructing it later from git history is much harder than writing it down
now.
